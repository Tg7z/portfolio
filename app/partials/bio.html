    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in New Zealand but in late 2013 I decided it was fianlly time to fly the coop and discover what it's like on the other side of the world.</p>
    <p>Having spent two years in employment at <a href="http://e-see.com" title="Find out more about e-see on their website">E-see International</a> I had learnt a lot and my career direction was now pointing in a different to what it had when I started there.</p>
    <p>Initially I joined e-see&reg; with a design oriented education and a focus on brand. They were the perfect company for me to start my formal employment with as the core of their buisness was a <a href="http://brandfm.com" title="BrandFM is a web based application and online storage repository where you can find, upload, organize, share, download and send brand files and media">Brand Asset Management app</a>. As my role progressed I was spending more time working on web projects and developed my skills in web coding. Initially this was more advanced HTML and CSS but as time went by I upskilled into JavaScript.</p>
    <p>I found myself enjoying the challenges of designing and coding for the web. There was also the darkside, however, I became much more aware of and frustrated by counter-intuitive user experiences. I hope to contribute to solutions that are not only beautiful but also intuitive for end users and easily maintainable for future developers.</p>
    <p>I now have a keen interest in crafting intuitive and rich user experiences and am very intrigued by the potential of next generation client-side MV* frameworks such as <a href="http://angularjs.org/" title="AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, that assists with running single-page applications.">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://emberjs.com/" title="Ember.js is an open-source client-side JavaScript web application framework based on the model-view-controller software architectural pattern.
