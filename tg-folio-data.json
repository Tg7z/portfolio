The catch was that this site was a blog based catalogue of their vehicles and they wanted the new site to look like an app and provide an easier method for them to manage their vehicle listings.</p>\n<p>I build the site on top of Adobe Business Catalyst and created a web app feel through custom Ajax to manage the vehicle catalogue and customised Twitter Bootstrap styling. The site uses typeahead filtering and has a management section that allows a manager to create and edit listings and upload photos.</p>\n<img src=\"img/posts/portfolio/selectedautos-ipad.png\" title=\"The Selected Autos webapp as seen on an iPad \">\n<img src=\"img/posts/portfolio/selectedautos-iphone.png\" title=\"The Selected Autos webapp as seen on an iPhone \">\n<img src=\"img/posts/portfolio/selectedautos.png\" title=\"The Selected Autos webapp as seen on the desktop \">",
