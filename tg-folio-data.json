As the site was built on Adobe Business Catalyst I leveraged the systems ecommerce capabilities and quickly had a solution for them.</p>\n<p>This website was designed to have the feel of an old fashioned lolly shop with cue's taken from Rainbow's long history as one on New Zealand's oldest confectionery makers. It was designed and built on top of Adobe Business Catalyst for all markets. Working with the Oamaru (NZ) based management team. Features include full CMS with staff access for editing. Unique horizontal  slider layout with hand illustrated images and backgrounds.

In January I was approached to re-skin the site of <a href=\"http://www.graffitimedia.com/\" title=\"Visit Graffiti Media\">Graffiti Media</a>, a Video Production company based in Los Angeles and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>On the original project I worked with the Graffiti team in both Los Angeles and New Zealand to build a very simple design using the Vimeo video service to embed demo reels into the site. Graffiti staff can show demo reels no matter where they are, in the office, on location, with the client or over coffee.</p>\n<img src=\"img/posts/portfolio/graffiti-old.jpg\" title=\"The original Graffiti Media website\">\n<p>The original Graffiti Media site.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-column\">\n<p>The new site needed to be a little sleeker and easier to maintain. I was provided some examples of what the client was after and set loose to provide it for them. The primary updates I made we style, the client wanted to maintain the grid style they have but make it more dynamic.</p>\n<img src=\"img/posts/portfolio/graffiti.jpg\" title=\"The new Graffiti Media website\">\n<p>I added new styles so the client could have featured videos with a larger tile, the default tile style was also reviewed. This new tile layout presented a problem, gaps were left at the end of a row if the tile was too big to fit. To address this issue I wrote a script in jQuery to reorder the elements so they would fit, this script is fired when the page is resized past each break-point.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-row\">\n<div class=\"post-column\">\n<img src=\"img/posts/portfolio/graffiti-video.jpg\" title=\"The new Graffiti Media websites video drawer\">\n<p>I also reviewed the manner the video was shown when the user selected a tile. Previously the video opened in a modal, the new site opens a drawer below the menu and displays the video and some information in that allowing for quick changes between clips and additional context.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-column\">\n<img src=\"img/posts/portfolio/graffiti-devices.jpg\" title=\"The new Graffiti Media website as seen on the iPhone and iPad\">\n<p>Of course the whole site is responsive working across all devices.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
